                <h3 id='title1'>Chicken</h3>
                <p>The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated subspecies of the red junglefowl originally
                    from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and younger male may be
                    called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen
                    and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.

                    Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until
                    the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries BC). Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source
                    of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.

                    Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7
                    billion as of 2018, up from more than 19 billion in 2011. There are more chickens in the world
                    than any other bird. There are numerous cultural references to chickens – in myth, folklore and
                    religion, and in language and literature.

                    Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East
                    Asia, but the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the
                    Indian subcontinent. From ancient India, the chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to
                    Greece by the 5th century BC. Fowl have been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with
                    the "bird that gives birth every day" having come from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia,
                    according to the annals of Thutmose III.
                    Chickens are omnivores. In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects and
                    even animals as large as lizards, small snakes, or young mice.

                    The average chicken may live for 5-10 years, depending on the breed. The world's oldest known
                    chicken lived 16 years according to Guinness World Records.

                <h3 id='title2'>Beef</h3>
                <p>Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle. In prehistoric times, humans hunted aurochs and
                    later domesticated them. Since then, numerous breeds of cattle have been bred specifically for the
                    quality or quantity of their meat.People have eaten the flesh of bovines from prehistoric times;
                    some of the earliest known cave paintings, such as those of Lascaux, show aurochs in hunting
                    scenes. People domesticated cattle to provide ready access to beef, milk, and leather. Cattle
                    have been domesticated at least twice over the course of evolutionary history. The first
                    domestication event occurred around 10,500 years ago with the evolution of Bos taurus. The second
                    was more recent, around 7,000 years ago, with the evolution of Bos indicus in the Indus Valley.
                    There is a possible third domestication even 8,500 years ago, with a potential third species Bos
                    africanus arising in Africa.[8] Most cattle originated in the Old World, with the exception of bison
                    hybrids, which originated in the Americas. Examples include the Wagyū from Japan, Ankole-Watusi from
                    Egypt, and longhorn Zebu from the Indian subcontinent.

                    In the United States, the growth of the beef business was largely due to expansion in the Southwest.
                    Upon the acquisition of grasslands through the Mexican–American War of 1848, and later the expulsion
                    of the Plains Indians from this region and the Midwest, the American livestock industry began,
                    starting primarily with the taming of wild longhorn cattle. Chicago and New York City were the first
                    to benefit from these developments in their stockyards and in their meat markets.</p><br>

                <h3 id='title3'>Sushi</h3>
                <p>Sushi is a traditional Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice, usually with some sugar and salt,
                    accompanied by a variety of ingredients, such as seafood, often raw, and vegetables. Styles of sushi
                    and its presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as
                    shari, or sumeshi.A dish known as narezushi (馴れ寿司, 熟寿司 – "salted fish"), stored in fermented rice
                    for possibly months at a time, has been cited as one of the early influences for the Japanese
                    practice of applying rice on raw fish. The fish was fermented with rice vinegar, salt, and rice,
                    after which the rice was discarded. The process can be traced back to the early domestication of
                    rice in the neolithic cultures of China, fermentation methods following similar logic in other asian
                    rice cultures include: Pla ra (ปลาร้า), Burong isda, Sikhae (식해), Amazake (甘酒) . The
                    lacto-fermentation of the rice prevents the fish from spoiling. When wet-field rice cultivation was
                    introduced during the Yayoi period, lakes and rivers would flood during the rainy season and fish
                    would get caught in the rice paddy fields. Pickling was a way to preserve the excess fish and
                    guarantee food for the next months, and Narezushi became an important source of protein for Japanese
                    consumers. The term sushi literally means "sour-tasting" and comes from an antiquated し (shi)
                    terminal-form conjugation, 酸し sushi, no longer used in other contexts, of the adjectival verb 酸い sui
                    "to be sour"; the overall dish has a sour and umami or savoury taste. Narezushi still exists
                    as a regional specialty, notably as funa-zushi from Shiga Prefecture.</p><br>
