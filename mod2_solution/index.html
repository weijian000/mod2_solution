        <p id="title">Chicken</p>
        <p id='section'>
            Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world. Owing to the relative ease and low cost of
            raising chickens—in comparison to mammals such as cattle or hogs—chicken meat and chicken eggs have
            become prevalent in numerous cuisines.

        <p id='section'>
            Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle. In prehistoric times, humans hunted aurochs and
            later
            domesticated them. Since then, numerous breeds of cattle have been bred specifically for the quality
            or
            quantity of their meat.
